# Association for Regaining Focus
### By Couguhl

A common problem of early tulpa creation is a lack of focus on the part of the
host. This may be because he/she may have an attention deficit disorder, are
overly-creative (not always a negative thing), or for other reasons not
specified. Nonetheless, this guide describes how you can increase your focus
and synchronicity with your tulpa(s) through the magic of classical
conditioning.

So before we start the method, you need to know how it works.
This method uses Classical Conditioning, which is essentially reinforcing
a reaction based on an unrelated stimulus that has been associated with it. For
example - Ivan Pavlov, the Russian physiologist who developed this idea, would
ring a bell and feed some meat to his dogs. The meat would make the dogs
salivate. After a while, the dogs would begin to salivate once the bell had
been rung, even if there were no meat in sight. They had been conditioned to
salivate every time the bell rang.
You can do this with your mind as well.

Now what this method is attempting to accomplish is to associate your tulpa
with whatever stimulus you choose. Hopefully, if you can associate your tulpa
with that stimulus, then you can use that stimulus to bring your tulpa vividly
back to mind whenever you are having trouble concentrating.

For example, when I first began tulpa forcing, I would burn incense. Since
smell is strongly associated with memory (and because I burned it every time),
I began to get 'in the zone' every time I burned incense. Now whenever I smell
it (even though I don't use it anymore), I vividly remember my tulpa and it
brings back a lot of memories. So what you can do is burn a scented candle,
incense, or whatever you find most effective.

If smells aren't your thing (I'm looking at you, anosmiacs), then you could try
taste. One day several months ago, I was sitting down with my tulpa having
a conversation while eating chips and salsa. Since then, every time I ate chips
and salsa I would start talking to my tulpa, and now she automatically comes to
mind whenever I taste Picante.

These are simply examples of course, and you can use any sort of stimulus that
you desire. If you can do this, then all you have to do is reintroduce that
stimulus when you are lacking focus.

That's basically all there is to it. If you have any suggestions, feedback, or
criticism then post away.
