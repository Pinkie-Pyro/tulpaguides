# Forcing via Self Hypnosis
### By LinkZelda

You probably clicked the link to this guide and thought:

"Self-hypnosis, what the heck is wrong with this guy?"

Then you probably starting thinking of situations (probably visualizations) on
the absurdity of hypnosis in a tulpa forum

Then you started to add feedback to whatever visualization you had, and you're
probably now convinced that hypnosis is the stereotypes of "not being able to
remember anything from the trance state" and what have you. This idea
solidified into your mind, you made the implication that it's impractical; you
made the suggestion that it is absurd; you easily went into a suggestive state
that hypnosis doesn't seem logical at all when tulpaforcing.

(I'll explain later on in the guide on why I said that, and you should be able
to know what I mean by it).

If you think this guide is too long, then you should back to the tulpa chat or
lurk the forum around wondering, "lol0z how doz I tulpaforce." If you're
willing to spend hours on tulpa.info standing around and wasting time, they
surely you'll have more than enough time to read this guide out.

Also, most of the guide will be what I took notes on reading a book called "A
Practical Guide to Self-Hypnosis" by Melvin Powers. Except, I'm going to give
my opinions (obviously) and also show an example of utilizing self-hypnosis to
gradually improve your ability to tulpaforge, imposition, possession, almost
any kind of tulpa related ability and soon-to-be discovered (yeah that's
right).

### Things you will learn from this guide

 * Learning the misconceptions and presumed "dangers" of hypnosis. (I'm pretty
 sure some people think it's not having any awareness of what's going on; and
 you'll realize there's not really any kind of catastrophic danger (i.e.
 jumping off a cliff or "z0mg my tulpa is going to stab me))


 * A useful analogy (that I learned from the reading) of how getting into the
 suggestion state is done.

 * The Power of Suggestion

 * A simple version of the example of self-hypnosis (this is just an example,
 you can use it if you want, but don't take it to absolute law; it's served to
 be for experimentation)

 * A more advanced version of the example of self-hypnosis (Utilizing "Present
 tense" commands and going further into them for better efficacy, etc.)

 * An Eureka! Moment and the sudden urge to try this out for a few weeks (it's
 definitely worth it)

So if you're ready for this, get your tulpa and snuggle up for a reading that
I'm sure will be worth your while (remember, you just have to work at it like
any other technique)

DISCLAIMER: I do not want to state as fact that this guide will 100% work for
you, it's solely dependent on you learning through the mechanics of the steps,
and trying them out yourself. Honestly, if you want an example of what this
guide will be....Self-fulfilling prophecy (to some extent). Don't let the word
discourage you though.

If you want to know just Tests #1-5 (to get into the light state quicker that
is enough for basic tulpaforcing/visualization/etc.) Just focus on these
sections I recommend below:

"TL ; DR version of Self-Hypnosis process"

"Why Command => Visualize => Feedback Response HELPS A LOT"

"Tests #1-5 Sayings"

This is for people who just want to do something quickly, and even so, please
take your time those three sections I recommended. Don't feel bad if things
don't work out, just GO WITH THE FLOW.

## HYPNO#1: Misconceptions and Presumed "Dangers" of Hypnosis (Mini-FAQ)

### HYPNO#1-A : What is Hypnosis?

I just wanted to get this section covered first just to make sure people don't
get anxious and think that "omgz0rs, what if my tulpa goes Glad0s on me and
kills everyone!??!?"

Hypnosis is simply reaching a state of suggestibility, and the prime example of
this is our subconscious. Like in most default hypnosis guides you see (e-how
and such unfortunately), they usually don't go in-depth on misconceptions or
why this certain mechanic works. Those types of guides are made to cater to
everyone with many different beliefs.

### HYPNO#1-B : What are the three stages of hypnosis

There's usually three states of hypnosis that get heavier in suggestibility and
such (at least mentioned in the guide):

 * Light State  (Lethargic State)

 * Medium State  (Cataleptic State)

 * Deep State  (Somnambulistic State)

I won't bother explaining them, but just putting that out there because the
"tests" you'll be using for your self-hypnosis help you transcend into deeper
states of hypnosis (and with practice, you're going to be amazed at how much
you can bond with your tulpa).

### HYPNO#1-C : Is Hypnosis Dangerous?

Since hypnosis is one simply reaching a state of suggestibility, people
(especially tulpamancers who don't really want to read much about it) usually
think that it might create some risks, like:

- Their tulpa going glad0s mode on them and destroying all their host

- Insert any other worse case scenario here

To give a simple explanation to this, do not worry about the dangerous because
they're unlikely to happen. You can easily get out of the hypnosis state when
you use reasonable commands and cues, so you won't jump off a cliff or some
other silly anxious thought because of hypnosis.

### HYPNO#1-D : What Do You Think Hypnosis Is?

Based on the reading, I've agreed that hypnosis is learning how to:

1. Using commands/phrase (saying aloud or in your head)

2. Adding Visualizations to solidify the command/phrase

3. Adding feed-back response to solidify #1 and #2

4. These create a conditioned response, and the more you're used to it, the
   FASTER you'll be able to tulpaforge (of course, don't try to rush it, TAKE
   YOUR TIME DOING IT)

You'll understand all this in the advanced version of the example I'll set up
(and the same process is just the same as Melvin Powers laid it out, except
you'll be mixing it up for your tulpa-related endeavors)

### HYPNO#1-E : Useful analogy to Describe Hypnosis

Here's a simple analogy that Melvin stated himself in the guide. I'm basically
going to paraphrase it and add my opinion on it. (My opinions/explanation will
be like this)

Getting into the stages of hypnosis is like going to a pool of water. You
usually don't catapult yourself altogether; you want to test the waters first
to get a sense of the temperature by putting one of your feet in.

(This means you're doing things gradually, just like how you want to use
self-hypnosis for tulpaforcing/imposition/etc.).

Then as you get used to the waters, you slowly let your legs into the water,
and eventually, the thighs, waist, stomach, chest, and such is completely in
the water.

(This means that at this point when you're deep in the pool, you're probably
already in a deep state of hypnosis).

### HYPNO#1-F : Will I remember anything being in a trance/hypnotic state?

Of course! People usually think that if they were to go to a hypnotist that
they can't remember what they said, or that there was some kind of hocus-pocus
going on that prevented them from remembering anything. The thing is (and this
is just my opinion), we can easily get out of the trance state with practice,
and the trance state does not mean "I lose all voluntary control over myself"

During this whole process of self-hypnosis, you will remember what you're going
through (unless you sleep, but if you find yourself getting tired/sleepy, IT'S
WORKING; you just have to get used to the sensations and keep your AWARENESS up
the next attempt) NEVER GIVE UP.

From personal experience, I've slept through several self-hypnosis sessions
because the commands/phrases I used really worked in getting me relaxed that
I wasn't used to these sensations coming so fast. Even after ~ 2months, I'm
still aiming to get better (and I have gotten better at it). It's definitely
worth it, and even just tulpaforcing (without thinking about hypnosis) is
essentially YOU getting into the suggestive state.

This is merely you speeding things up a bit when you have the conditioned
responses set up.

### HYPNO#1-G : What position should I be in for self-hypnosis?

I personally recommend **sitting up** because as you practice these tests
(and/or your tests), you'll find that lying down on the bed might make you fall
asleep REALLY fast. You can try lying down, but if you don't want to frequently
have yourself wake up at a random time going "CRAP!" just try sitting up.

You have have back problems and such with sitting up, You can simply sit on
a chair, place pillows on them for the seat and for the back rest; the same
applies if you're bracing on a wall while sitting on your bed/water
bed/whatever you rest on.

### HYPNO#1-H : What the heck is ABCD?

This is for people who read the TL;DR version and don't understand what ABCD is
for that section (the advanced explanation solves this issue)

## HYPNO#2 : TL ; DR version of Self-Hypnosis process

Note, this is just an example, and it's based from the guide from Melvin-Powers
(This is what I used for Shockk during his trance sessions I did with him, and
if you want his opinions, ask and I'm sure he'll be glad to tell you how
effective it is when you get used it; whether it's someone doing the hypnosis
on you, or you doing it on yourself (or even your tulpa(e)!!!))

Yes, this is the TL ; DR (*gasp*). If you want to stop here and take a break
after reading the previous sections (or using Ctrl+ F and being mind-boggled at
the so called "brevity" of this version), do so. Just take your time, try to
get a quick run of how the techniques work a few times, then go back and do
them more extensively.

To make things easier for yourself, copy the TL ; DR version below, and then
when you have time, go to the advanced version section and see the example
phrases/commands I placed. Go through each test and digest as much info as you
need (for your case, it would just be Tests #1  5 for basic tulpaforcing,
etc.)

* 1. Eye-lid Test (Saying a phrase that "As I reach X number, I shall be in
     a deeper state of hypnosis and feel relaxed."

* 1. A : Each count up to (ten for example), you state a phrase that gets
     deeper (or it can be a simple phrase repeated if you want)

* 1. B : As you go through each count and state the phrase, you visualize
     yourself getting into the hypnotic state and whatever conditions the test
     you're doing.

* 1. C : When you finish a count (example: when you finish counting to one
     -> saying phrase -> visualizing -> then saying the next number with feedback
     based on the count that happened before -> and so on until TEN (or whatever
     number you want to count up to).

* 1. D : When you reach to ten or the end point for a certain test, you confirm
     to yourself that you're in a deeper state of hypnotic state, and that
     you'll insert whatever suggestive state you'll be in as you go more into
     the session

* 2. Swallow Test (Basically repeating ABCD, except you're using the commands, visualization, and feedback for that specific test).

* 3. Hand-Tingling Test ( Again, same as #1 and #2, but you do ABCD parts for
     the specific test; remember, you're using different commands/phrases for
     different tests; it sounds like a pain, but with practice, you'll have
     simple phrases come to you quickly))

* 4. Feet Test => ABCD

* 5.  Hand Levitation Test => ABCD (You can even get your tulpa into this if
      you're decent at possession!!!)

WHEN YOU REACHED THE LIGHT STATE  (Usually for your first runs, this state is
MORE than enough to tulpaforce proficiently, meaning when you do the 5 tests
and are conditioned to those reactions/responses, you do whatever you want from
this point.. (tulpaforge/impose/vocalization training/etc. ) - (the next tests
are if you want to get more into it; (Examples: Actually being able to feel the
warmth of your tulpa by imagining yourself hugging them, etc.)

NOTE: If you want to do more than just visualize your tulpa/impose them/etc.,
the next tests are for you. These are usually for more deeper interaction with
your tulpa, and depending on your persistence with this, you could be immersed
into your wonderland or that special place with your and your tulpae, and
you'll be in a "dream-like" state that you're aware of. It's not as powerful or
intense as a LUCID DREAM, but the experience is AMAZING.

(I had a brief moment of the deeper states of hypnosis, and I was ECSTATIC at
how much I felt away from reality and more with Eva).

For these states, I recommend you find days where you have more hours to do
this, because it's definitely worth it.

* 6. Fly Test => ABCD =>

You're imagining a fly on your hand, and it gets annoying and you just have the
urge to slap your hand (this one is actually funny because by this point, you
should be able to feel as if there really is a fly on your hand)

*  7. Sun Test =>ABCD =>

Using suggestions to feel the warmth of the sun halfway on your count, and then
imagining the sun's warmth going away (this prepares for the next test)

*  8. Breeze Test => ABCD =>

You're basically using suggestions that you'll feel a breeze (this is like
a tease or preparing for the dream-like state in the second to last test)

*  9.  Handclasp Test => ABCD =>

You interlock your hands, and clasp them together and give suggestions that
it'll be impossible to unlock them, then you [i]**continue**[/i] to count to
a higher number you want with the suggestion that you'll be able to unlock them
easily.

*  10. Arm Test => ABCD =>

Fist one hand, spread your arm out, count to a certain number with suggestions
that you'll be unable to bend your hand. Then as you [i]**continue**[/i] to
count to the next highest number you want, you give the suggestion that you'll
be able to bend your arm easily.

*  11. Eye Test (different from the eye-lid test because by this time, you're
       trying to open your eyes) => ABCD =>

You imagine yourself feeling context, relaxed, at ease and making suggestions
that you'll try to open your eyes, but you can't because it requires too much
energy, and having your eyes closed is more enjoyable (this helps with
grounding yourself for wonderlands, tulpaforcing, concentration, etc.)

From here, you do the same as you did for the other tests (that you'll feel
perfectly normal and aware)

*  12. Music Test (this could also be altered for VOCALIZATION TRAINING!!!
       (z0mg, you're excited huh?!?) => ABCD =>

*This is the part where you give a suggestion that a certain number, you'll
hear your favorite song and it will last for one minute and gradually fade
away. ** You  can alter this and do more advanced vocal training with your
tulpa instead!!!  (if it doesn't work, just keep trying)***

*  13. Dream Test => ABCD (This is the part where it gets AMAZING, and you
       might end up crying with job or some other euphoric emotion when you get
       out of it) =>

*You basically count to three (use the ABCD way with it) and have the assurance
you'll have a dream lasting for several minutes*

*  14. "Anesthesia" Test => ABCD (Like Powers said, don't use pins or try to
       cut yourself okay?) =>

*You're telling yourself you won't feel any pain (honestly I never reached this
far because the dream test is what I enjoy the most, this is just optional, and
like I said before, you don't have to be so serious in following every single
thing; mix things up a bit if you want)!*

### HYPNO#2-A : Why Command => Visualize => Feedback Response HELPS A LOT

The next section after this is simply going to be example
suggestions/phrases/commands/ to utilize for teach test. But before I do that,
let me explain the "Say Command" => "Visualize" => "Feedback Response"

In order to make a conditioned response, there has to be some kind of memory of
it, whether it's visualization, auditory, etc. it's sustained by some memorable
experience.

Example (A generic one, but you should get the point):

### HYPNO#2-B : More Explanation on Tests (Suggestions/Phrases/Commands to Use for Each Test)

Here I'll simply state the number (Ex: 1. ) and the example phrases you can
use. You don't have to follow them to absolute law, these are just for
experimentation; feel free to make your own, but the idea behind them is that
you utilize "PRESENT" tense words (it helps a lot because the subconscious is
more suited for the now/present/status-quo/in the moment/etc.

Hopefully you have the "TL ; DR" handout I had in the previous section, it'll
make things easier for you (sorry that I didn't combine them, but I just wanted
to show people the simple way and then this section for the details; please
forgive me, just trying to do this for everyone's convenience.

ALL of these examples implies you count to ten; some will have where you count
to ten, but you also continue to count to 15 after you reached 10 mostly for
feeling normal again after the specific test; some imply you just count to 3 or
5, but these are usually for the deeper tests.

If you want to get the information for Test #1-#5, just focus the phrases/etc.
for those instead and come back to the other tests some other time when you
mastered or you set the conditioned responses for Tests #1-#5

Also, counting to 10 is ideal because it's just enough to where it's not too
long to reach and not too short to where you might have to repeat the saying
again.

## HYPNO#2-C: Tests #1-5 Sayings

HERE GOES (hope you have the TL;DR copied for your convenience):

PRE-WARMUP SAYING (this is what you use in case for emergencies and any
apparent dangers in real life ahead (fire, burglary, etc.); it's also to make
posthypnotic suggestions (suggestions that happen AFTER you're finished or are
engrained as "back-ups"):

Pre-warmup (optional) # 1Breathe in....(think or say aloud "Relax") Breathe
out...(think or say aloud "Relax") Do it a few times (5-10) (Remember the
analogy I mentioned in the earlier section of how hypnosis works?)

"During this session, I shall be able to direct post-hypnotic suggestions to
the subconscious with ease. I shall be able to get out of the hypnotic stages
with ease as soon as I count to ..."

*insert the magical number; it doesn't matter which number, just as long as you
know that when you want to get out of the hypnotic state, you just say that and
count to that number you want.*

#### TEST #1 EXAMPLE SAYINGS:

Before engaging in test:

"As I count to ten, my eyelids shall be relaxed that it would require too much
effort to open them. I shall be in a deeper state of hypnosis, and I shall be
aware through the whole session" (That's a post-hypnotic suggestion by the way
; repeat this once more *if needed*)

Doing the first test:

"One..My eyelids are feeling relaxed...."

(Visualize=>Add Feedback Response with the next count)

"Two...My eyelids are more relaxed, I can feel content and getting into
a deeper state of hypnosis."

(Visualize => Add Feedback Response with the next count; this is exactly how it
goes through most of the tests)

"Three...My eyelids are more relaxed than before, and it's becoming harder to
open my eyes."

"Four...My eyelids are getting heavier, and it's even more difficult to open my
eyes.."

"Five...My eyelids are very heavy, it requires too much effort to open them..."

"Six...My eyelids are relaxing more, and it's too difficult to open them...."

(See how this was a repeat? It's okay if you want to do this instead, but try
to make each count more confident and more assured than the last count)

"Seven...My eyelids are so heavy that it's getting difficult to open my eyes
without exerting much force."

"Eight....My eyelids are definitely becoming heavier and more difficult to open
without exerting much force."

(See how I mentioned "definitely"? This is a more confident and assured way of
suggestibility)

"Nine....My eyelids are absolutely becoming heavier and more relaxed that it's
hard to open without exerting much force."

"Ten..My eyes are now heavy and impossible to open even if I try to open them.
I am now in a deeper state of hypnosis (Remember the Visualization => Feedback
for these sayings all up until you count to ten or whatever number you want)

#### TEST #2 Sayings:

"As I count to ten, and before I count to ten, I shall have the irresistible
urge to swallow. Once I do, I shall count to ten and the urge to swallow will
slowly fade."

(when you get the urge to swallow before the count to ten; just count to
whatever number(s) is and use the second part of the phrase/command/suggestion)

"One...my throat is getting dry..."

"Two...my mouth is getting dry, the urge to swallow is increasing...."

(Do this until you actually swallow and then when you do...example)

"Six...the urge to swallow is slowly fading away..."

"Seven....the urge to swallow is continuing to fade away..."

"Eight....the urge to swallow is fading away and I shall not worry about having to swallow..."

"Nine...the urge to swallow is definitely fading away, and I shall not worry
about having to swallow..."

"Ten...the urge to swallow absolutely gone, and I shall not think about having
to swallow..."

#### TEST 3: Sayings:

You can use your left or right hand for this, or both, but for this example's
sake, just use one:

"As I count to five, I shall feel an increased tingling sensation in my hand.
As I continue to count to ten, my hand shall feel completely normal."

"One....I feel a tingling sensation in my hand...."

"Two...the feeling is increasing in my right hand...."

"Three...the feeling is definitely increasing in my right hand...."

"Four....the feeling is increasing exponentially in my right hand..."

"Five....the tingling sensation is absolutely increasing in my right hand..."

"Six....the tingling sensation is slowly decreasing in my right hand...."

"Seven...the tingling sensation is slowly decreasing in my right hand and I'm
slowly feeling normal again..."

"Eight....the tingling sensation is definitely decreasing in my right hand and
I'm feeling normal again.."

"Nine...the tingling sensation is absolutely decreasing in my right hand and
I'm feeling normal again..."

"Ten...the tingling sensation is gone, and I am completely normal. I am now in
a deeper state of hypnosis and shall be aware throughout this session."

#### TEST # 4 Sayings:

(at this point, you should be able to get the idea that's going on here, just
follow the guideline on the TL ; DR "handout" from the previous section and
make your own sayings...it should be very easy).

Just have a number (5 for instance) where you feel a heavy bar is on your feet,
and then as you continue to count to 10, the iron bar will melt and then harden
on your feet, making you more grounded and impossible to move your feet!

#### TEST #5 Sayings:

Basically count to 5 or whatever half-way mark where you'll feel your hand
getting lighter and lighter as you aim to touch your chin unconsciously....(by
unconsciously, without you moving your right and whole arm; this is the part
where your tulpa can "possess" your hand and arm and do the suggestion for
you....definitely will make them laugh and have some fun).

Then as you continue to the rest of your count, you should unconsciously (or
your tulpa should) reach your chin with your hand. Then as you count to 5, you
slowly put your hand back down and state you're in a deeper state of hypnosis,
etc.

**FROM THIS POINT, THIS IS ALL YOU NEED IF YOU JUST WANT TO GET INTO THE LIGHT
STATE OF HYPNOSIS. COME BACK TO THE REST WHEN YOU ARE CONDITONED AND USED TO
THESE FIRST FIVE TESTS. YOU CAN STILL READ ON IF YOU'RE CURIOUS, BUT TRY TO
MASTER THESE FIVE STATES BEFORE TRYING TO DO ALL THE TESTS.**

### HYPNO#2-D : Tests #6-14

#### TEST #6 Sayings:

Just make sayings up to 5 where you get the strong sensation of a fly on your
hand, then for the rest until ten, you'll feel the sensation of the "annoying
fly" on your hand fading away.

#### TEST #7 Sayings:

Make sayings that suggest you can feel the warmth as you count to 5, and then
the warmth going away all until 10.

#### TEST #8 Sayings:

Same at #7, except you feel the breeze, then it slowly fades away

#### TEST #9

Pretty straight-forward, just follow the short explanation in the TL ; DR version

#### TEST #10

Same...make sayings up until 5 that your arm will be stiff and unable to bend,
then the rest of the count you'll gradually be able to bend it with ease.

#### TEST #11

Just count up to 10 or 5 that trying to open your eyes will make an unpleasant
experience, and how closing them and keeping them closed is more pleasant.

BY THE TIME YOU REACH TO 12, you should be in the MEDIUM STATE, the LAST THREE
TESTS are for getting into the HEAVY STATE :

#### TEST #12

Just Count up to three (without worry about any sayings/phrases/etc.) that
you'll listen to your favorite song OR listen to your tulpa (advanced
vocalization training in a deeper hypnotic state!)

#### TEST #13

Just count up to 3 or 5 and make a suggestion that you'll have a dream (like
being with your tulpa and having all that unconditional love-dovey stuff) for
several minutes

(THIS IS PROBABLY WHERE YOU'LL BE HAPPY....the last test is OPTIONAL)

#### Test #14

Just make a suggestion that you won't feel any pain (don't stab/cut/injure
yourself/dig skin deeply with nails please)

## HYPNO#3 : More Hypnosis Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

> Question #1: Dude, omg, what's wrong?!?! I don't feel anything!!!

If you don't feel yourself getting into the hypnotic state, "STOP expecting" it
to happen...just go through the process. As long as you visualize, add feedback
(with the next count's saying), you'll be fine.

It's not supposed to be "I'm suppose to be this way when I reach this state,"
it's just simply having confidence and using present tense and demanding (not
desperate) words that will get you far. Chances are, if you don't feel you're
more relaxed, it probably ***eluded*** you. That's perfectly fine, just keep
going.

If you stumble, just continue where you left off, or start from where you think
you left off, or just start over with the specific test you stumbled a bit on.


> Question #2: Man, this guide was long, "TL;DR" !!!$!elventyone11

Well, if you want to spend the rest of your time lurking around the forum and
not getting your butt back into tulpaforcing (and possibly using self-hypnosis
for more productive results), then just don't read the guide! If you can't help
yourself, no one else can do much for you!

> Question #3: You said to use present tense, but you used "shall in those
example sayings/declarations/suggestions/commands!!

"Shall" is a future tense word, but it has a more demanding vibe to it. It's
implying that this is GOING TO HAPPEN as if it's WHAT YOU'VE BEEN
DESTINED/BORNED/NATURAL AT. Words like "will" imply,

"Okay, it kinda might happen, ya know?"

We don't want that. Use "Shall," and be confident with it.

> Question #4: Help! (specific Test #1 is confusing!) Help!

I'll do my best to answer any questions you have. I didn't want to make the
guide TOO long (it's already at 4,639 words the moment I typed "already" )

> Question #5: Help! I had a difficult time getting out of the hypnotic state,
is this a bad thing? Will I becomez deh crazies?

It's perfectly normal if you couldn't get out of the hypnotic state when
counting to a certain number while suggesting you'll be able to get out of it
with ease. Next time it happens, just relax, and simply count up (or down if
you want).

You're not going to be crazy or have any kind of mental defects if you couldn't
get out of the state. Being in such a deep state is easy to get out of. Just
relax and repeat as needed.

### HYPNO#3-A

Well, that was one big guide, but I'm positive by the end of this guide (or at
least those who used the shortcut with CTRL+ F on my list of recommended
sections for just Tests #1-5), you'll feel confident about self-hypnosis,
cleared any misconceptions of it, and had general questions answered as well.

Thank you all for reading, and this IS GOING TO HELP if you just WORK towards
it. It may suck, you may find yourself dozing off easier, but trust me, when
you're dozing off, you're getting into the lethargic (light state) quicker!

When you can still be aware and sustain yourself despite feeling the tired
sensations, you will become proficient in tulpaforcing/imposition/whatever
tulpa-related skill you want to practice in the light state of hypnosis!

And if you go beyond towards Tests #6-13 (#14 is optional), you'll have an
AMAZING experience with your tulpae!

If you have any questions, feel free to comment below, and I'll respond to the
best of my abilities!
