# A Metaphysical Tulpa Guide
### By Agent\_Nycto

Hey everyone, Agent\_Nycto here. This is going to be some pretty deep shit that 
we are talking about in here, covering some basic metaphysical theories, how 
they apply to tulpas, and even techniques to get you started. There's going to 
by funny pictures. There's going to be tears. There will be laughter. There may 
even be a quiz at the [end.](http://i.imgur.com/rh8feBw.jpg)

But first...

**IF YOU DISAGREE WITH METAPHYSICAL THOUGHT, AND WANT TO BE A DICK ABOUT IT, 
READ THE EVERLOVING FUCK OUT OF THE FOLLOWING.** 

Look, I get it. We. All. Get. It. There is absolutely no concrete, scientific 
proof for any of this. I said it. Right there. You don't have to tell us. We 
know we could very well be wrong about all of this. Everything that anyone has 
ever really gotten has been personal anecdotes and experiences, and some of this stuff is even untestable. 

And that's ok. 

Even if someone else is thinking something that's stupid, that's ok. You don't 
have to make yourself look like an asshole by yelling at people for feeling 
a certain way. No one is trying to force this down your throat, no one has 
a gun to your head (I'm assuming). This whole post is tagged as metaphysical, 
so if you're not down with it, you don't have to tell us that we are all wrong 
and stupid for thinking about it. 

Here's an alternative, if you absolutely feel the need to tell someone they are 
stupid, or demand proof, or cause a conflict or 
[whatthefuckever](http://i.imgur.com/H7v8Lp8.jpg)...

Hit back on your browser and read something else. 

Anything that you say will just make yourself look bad, and it will offend some 
other people. We're all into tulpas, so we're all out on the same limb here. 
What you think is possible other people think is pants-on-head retarded, too. 
If you really, absolutely, cannot-do-without-talking shit about this or have 
a pointed question or whatever, sure, [you can message 
me.](http://i.imgur.com/QS68KpR.jpg) I reserve the right to rip you a new 
asshole if you're a twat waffle, but if you have genuine questions or anything, 
I will answer them. Just know you'll be getting the same treatment you give me.

**IF YOU AGREE WITH METAPHYSICAL THOUGHT, BUT STILL WANT TO BE A DICK ABOUT 
THIS GUIDE, READ THE EVERLOVING FUCK OUT OF THE FOLLOWING.** 

This is, in my opinion, boiling everything down to it's basic core theory. You, 
however, might have some different ideas on how things work, and will possibly 
disagree with me about something. That's cool. But the same rule for the people 
who aren't into this applies to you. Don't be an asshat. There's no reason to 
pick a  fight with me, or anyone else, if you disagree with them. If you think 
everything I did was wrong in this, then write your own damned guide. [I really 
don't care.](http://i.imgur.com/uQCWr8M.gif) If you have questions or comments 
you want to ask somewhere other than on here, yeah, feel free to message me. But just like above, expect the same treatment you give out. 

FUCK ALL OF THESE WARNINGS, JUST DON'T BE AN [ASSHOLE](http://i.imgur.com/iR712Se.jpg). 

[So...](http://youtu.be/dEtm_Q2LK9g) the guide.

METAPHYSICAL SHIT. [HOW](http://i.imgur.com/EaIsqVU.png) THE FUCK DOES THAT 
WORK?

[Magic.](http://i.imgur.com/2AOzort.gif)

FUCK YOU ANSWER THE QUESTION. 

Actually, I did. But here's the idea behind it. Living things make energy. It 
looks exactly like [this](http://i.imgur.com/PXaYssC.png), with no 
exaggerations whatsoever. When you burn off stuff that you eat, get pumped up 
because your teamsports have scored a pointsgoal, see a sideboob, or whatever, 
you are generating this energy. Some people call it Chi, some Ki, some 
Souldiarrhea, or whatever. It's the same shit. You can feel it when you have 
any strong emotional reaction to something, or when you're done fapping. 

Also, pretty fucking much everything is made up of and radiates this shit. Some 
stuff, people think, is better at making it, and making different kinds of 
energy. This is why people dig them magical rocks and crystals so much, in 
theory they produce specific wavelengths, colors, or types of energy that does 
certain things. This is also true for certain places, and in a way, that sort 
of makes sense. There's a lot more energy flying around at a natural waterfall than a cubicle farm, and it's got a different type of feel than a rave or a metal concert. 

You can, with practice, do a whole lot of shit. You can sense energy within 
yourself more, you can control how much you make, either more or less, you can 
sense it around you. You can also learn to make your energy do all sorts of 
shit... basically... WHATEVER YOU FUCKING WANT. It's yours and a part of you, so who the fuck cares? You can make it into a ball or a cube or toss it around or throw it out into the universe to do who knows what. And that, basically, how magic works. Energy+intent. 

WHAT ABOUT ALL THE BLOOD RITES AND SIGILS AND CHANTING AND JERKING OFF ON ROCKS 
AND OTHER [BULLSHIT?](http://i.imgur.com/9nNaJYy.jpg)

That is exactly why this is the bullshit free guide. All of that other crap is 
just so that you can put yourself into a proper mindset and raise energy 
better. You don't need it. At all. It can help, sure, but basically it's all 
just raising energy and making it do shit. Sometimes it's to get the attention 
of certain deities or for religious reasons. But basically anyone who tells you 
that you *have* to draw some bullshit circle in the ground and drink dogs blood 
in a baseball field, they are full of [shit.](http://i.imgur.com/Wd2Mi3H.png) 

RIGHT, COOL, SO HOW THE FUCK DOES THIS APPLY TO TULPAS?

In this thought process, they are simply energy that you have made, by focusing 
on it constantly, that you have programmed sentience into. 
[Bi-zam](http://i.imgur.com/dvdv3tS.gif). You just made a sentient thoughtform.  
And if you're super advanced, you can even give it the ability to make it's own 
damned energy, so you have made, essentially, a spirit. Tied to you as much or 
as little as you guys want, in the kinkiest or non-kinkiest connotations 
[thereof](http://i.imgur.com/ogrzB0s.jpg). 

METAPHYSICAL SHIT COMPARED TO PSYCHOLOGICAL SHIT. 
[GO](http://i.imgur.com/RBlIU80.jpg).

So if you know anything about the two, this means that you've probably figured 
out the biggest difference is that in pychthought, the tulpa is still a part of 
your mind. In metathought, it's an actual, different, living **THING.** Sure on the energy/astral/whatever level, but it's a real, separate entity. Hypothetically, according to metathought, you can get your tulpa to help out with all sorts of shit that you couldn't if you just had another sentient personality in your head. 

BUT HOW CAN EVERYONE [HUG](http://i.imgur.com/h9OmHts.png) AND GET ALONG?

That's right, neither side has to fight each other, because EVERYONE CAN BE 
[WRONG.](http://youtu.be/2yqUpypQwGs)

If you're metathought, you can assume that people using psych techniques are 
raising energy and focusing it into a thoughtform. 

If you're psychthought, you can assume that the people using metathought are 
just doing something that helps their mental focus in making a tulpa. 

Or, you know, everyone can assume that their way is the best, and that the 
people using the other methods are just delusional about how it *really* 
[works.](http://i.imgur.com/ILQ6aDa.jpg)

So there you have it. People and stuff can make energy, you can learn to do stuff with that energy via willpower, and you can take energy and make it sentient, which makes it a tulpa. 

BUT HOW CAN I [DO?](http://i.imgur.com/Df8T7as.jpg) 

So you want to try it? First go meditate. There's a bajillion guides out there. 
Then, focus on yourself. Try to remember something that got you excited, like 
a roller coaster. Try to capture that feeling again, the rush, the exhilleration. Focus on that feeling, and try to sense the energy that is starting to work up inside of you.Some people say it feels like a warmth, other people say it feels like a tingling or electricity. 

[Congrats](http://i.imgur.com/QWHFUCa.jpg), you just figured out what your 
energy feels like.

 If you practice you can summon it out of nowhere, without even having to remember anything or sit down and focus. 

 If you have anything constructive or entertaining to say or ask, feel free to 
 comment below. If not, you can cram [it](http://i.imgur.com/7YQf5t6.jpg) up your ass and twist. 

 **EDIT** Put in the mentions of "being a dick about it" in the bold text up 
 top, because there are people from both sides of the theory who don't need 
 that warning, because they weren't planning on being dicks about it. Thanks 
 /u/reguile!
