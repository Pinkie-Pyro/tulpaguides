# Astral Projection
### By Ness

Astral projection occurs when your consciousness leaves your body. It is also
usually called an out of body experience, or OOBE/OBE. Some people experience
astral projection naturally, and it's no big deal, but for the rest of us, we
have to work at it. Hopefully, this article will help you with that.

Before we begin, though, I have a few more things to say. Astral projection has
proven itself to be fairly tricky. Most people attempt it for months and months
without really getting out of the body. Many of these people can feel
themselves getting close to leaving, so their hard work is not completely in
vain, and yet, they haven't gotten ALL the way out. This is no big deal. It
seems to be normal to have a bit of a struggle with this. The best advice I can
give is to practice a lot, at least once a day, more if you can, and if you
ever begin to get upset that you can't do it, just stay calm and continue
practicing. You can and will project when you're ready. Becoming angry and
trying to force it won't help you at all.

You should also know that your body doesn't die when you leave, or anything
weird like that. Your body continues to lie there, basically asleep. It
continues to breathe, pump blood, make waste, etc., even though you're not
there.

You also cannot be possessed by something/someone while astral projecting. When
you astral project, your consciousness is out of your body, but your soul
itself is still there. If your soul left your body when you astral projected,
your body would probably die. Your soul stays in place and you are at no
greater risk of being possessed/taken over than you are at any other time.

Also, you should try to be in a certain mind-set when you practice. It's hard
to describe, but it's basically a half awake/half asleep mode. You want to be
awake enough so that you can lay down and not fall asleep immediately, but you
also don't want to be totally wired, or else you won't be able to relax. You
don't have to be like this, but in my experience, along with several other
people, it helps a lot.

With ALL that being said, we can finally begin!

First of all, you need to be comfortable. You may sit or lay down, whichever
you prefer, but make sure you're comfortable. Make sure that you can be
completely relaxed in your chosen position, and it takes you absolutely no
effort. You also need to be comfortable in your clothes. If you are not,
change. You can't have any distractions while trying to astral project, or
you'll probably fail.

Once you're completely comfortable, close your eyes and relax. Make sure that
for this, you are ABSOLUTELY, ONE HUNDRED PERCENT relaxed. When you first sit
or lay down, you may feel relaxed already, but you should do a thorough check
of your entire body before continuing. Check each part of your body, even the
small parts, such as your fingers, toes and especially your face. I cannot
stress the face area enough. Honestly, I never noticed how tense my face was.
When I laid down to go to sleep at night, I felt completely relaxed, but once
I started practicing astral projection and actually paid attention to relaxing
my face, I noticed that it had been slightly tensed all along.

To relax completely, try flexing each body part individually, then relaxing it.
Repeat this a few times with each body part, then move onto the next part.
Eventually, when you're completely done, your entire body should feel slightly
numb and heavier than usual.

Once you're completely relaxed, visualize yourself leaving your body. You can
visualize yourself gently floating out of your body, or you can visualize
yourself jerking to the side and rolling out of your body. You can use any
visualization that you want, so feel free to experiment. While visualizing
yourself leaving your body, you should eventually begin to enter the
vibrational stage. You enter the vibrational stage when you're on your way out
of your body. It varies from person to person, but you will most likely feel as
if you're either shaking or swaying. You may also hear or see things. No matter
what happens, remember to stay calm and focused on leaving your body. If you
pay attention to how exciting these feelings are, you will lose focus on
leaving your body and you'll most likely have to start over from the beginning.
So, stay focused. Ignore anything you feel, hear, see, etc. Stay one hundred
percent focused on astral projecting.

Once you make your way through the vibrational stage, the feelings and/or
noises and/or visions should begin to gently fade away, and you should begin to
feel as if you're actually out of your body. In my experiences, I felt very
light and slightly cooler. Continue to focus on astral projecting, although
now, visualize yourself leaving your body completely.

Before we continue, I would like to take this chance to warn you about the
popping. That probably sounds scary, but it's actually nothing at all. It is
NOT dangerous, fatal, painful, etc. It's just an extremely loud pop that
I heard one time when I left my body. I was lying there, perfectly relaxed, far
into the vibrational stage, and then the vibrations began to fade. I was happy
about getting so far, but I remained focused on leaving my body. I visualized
myself floating straight up and out. Just as I felt myself leave my body
completely... POP! Like a shotgun going off in my ear. Right in my ear. Right
in my right ear, actually. It didn't hurt at all, like a normal incredibly loud
sound does, but it startled me so badly that I actually physically jumped, and
all that progress I had made that night was suddenly gone. Needless to say,
I was pretty angry, so I just rolled over and went to sleep. So, just consider
this a warning: there may be a very loud noise when you finally leave your
body. Just try your hardest not to be startled by it. Ignore it completely if
you can. Let's continue, now.

Once out of their body, some people visualize their eyes opening, and others
just will them to open. Others' eyes open automatically. Once you're out of
your body, if your eyes are still closed, just change your focus to opening
your eyes. They should, one way or another, open, and you should get some kind
of view. Most people describe it as being very vivid, and, in some cases,
a little blurry.

Shortly after getting out and looking around, most people feel as if they're
being pulled back into their bodies, and they soon wake up. If you get out and
then get sucked right back into your body, don't be discouraged. Be happy with
yourself for achieving your goal, and try again soon.

Once you can get out of your body and stay there for a little while, start to
focus on small movements, such as bending your arms or legs, or maybe even just
looking around. Start out small and easy, and work your way up to moving around
the room. Most people describe the movement as a "I'll just float over here,
now" kind of movement, so take your time learning it. Make sure you've got it
down completely before you try to go out on an adventure of some sort.

When you're finally done astral projecting and you want to return to your body,
you can try one of several methods to return. You can actually go back to your
body, lay down on yourself and visualize yourself sinking back in, or you could
just visualize yourself being sucked back in from wherever you are. You can
also just focus on waking up. It's up to you.

Now, if for some strange reason, you can't get back into your body, you'll
probably begin to panic, and once you become upset enough, you should wake up
automatically, as if you were having a bad dream or something. If, by some
chance, you are incredibly unlucky and even panicking isn't enough to make you
wake up, just wait it out. As you astral project, your physical body is
basically asleep, so if someone kicks down your door to see what you're doing,
you'll probably stop astral projecting and wake up. Also, if your body needs to
go to the bathroom, the urge will get stronger and stronger until you finally
wake up. Don't worry, though; I've never heard of anyone not being able to
reenter their body. You'll get back in, one way or another.

When you've finally gotten out of your body several times and you can keep
yourself out for a good amount of time, go have fun. Go see what your friends
are doing. Try flying way up into outer space, or diving way down to the bottom
of the ocean. Practice some Psionics while astral projecting. Be creative and
have fun!

Well, there you have it. Practice hard and often, and while practicing,
remember to stay calm and relaxed the ENTIRE time. Doing that, you shouldn't
have too much trouble with this.

Good luck!
