# Voice
## thought ping-pong

The idea is to have Lyra say something to me, then I examine the 
thought/mindvoice/whatever from her and send it back to her. I tell her how it 
sounded to me, sometimes along with advice like "try to speak louder", "a 
little higher" or "speak harder". ("Speak harder" is something Yolk advised me 
to ask her to do. I don't really understand how one speaks harder, but Lyra 
apparently did and it worked.) Then she tries to say the same thing again while 
following what I asked her to change. I examine that and send it back along 
with how I think it differs from the last one. Things like "that was better, 
can you do a little louder still?", "that made it all quiet again", or "it's 
clearer now but sounds squeaky and silly".

Yolk advised me to do this during the day, not just in tulpaforcing sessions. 
She says that hosts talk in something closer to tulpish when forcing. 
("Tulpish" is raw thoughts, which sometimes get improperly decoded into that 
gibberish speech that's often heard from young tulpae.) It also makes sense to 
do it during the day because you want to hear the tulpa during regular life, 
not just when forcing.

This works by giving her some idea of exactly how her speech is being 
perceived, along with immediate feedback on what I would like her to do 
differently. The night Yolk stepped me through doing this, I was able to get 
clear enough thoughts from Lyra for her to say a couple things to Yolk. This is 
also useful to do if I see that I'll be needing to get answers from her soon. 
For instance, a few times I've taken her to dinner at a mall food court or 
something; I usually choose what we eat, then we have ice cream or something, 
which she chooses. Before going for the ice cream, I test how well I can hear 
her and do this thought ping-pong thing until it's good enough.

# Possession
## don't relax and let go

The usual possession method is to thoroughly relax and try to let go of my 
control of the body, and then have Lyra try to cause movements. So far, we only 
have slow, weak, jerky hand movement from doing that. I suspect I'm doing 
something wrong  if I try to control my hand when doing this without grabbing 
back control and unrelaxing, I get exactly the same cruddy control that Lyra 
does. This makes me think that I'm blocking the signals after the last point 
where she can insert her movements.

What Lemonlemon did with Yolk is to not relax or let go at all. He created 
a pair of gloves in his wonderland and associated their movement with his 
hands' movement. That is, he moved his hands and imagined the gloves moving in 
sync with them. After he got this pretty well associated, he gave Yolk the 
gloves. He still had to watch her move and consciously make the movements 
himself at first, and it felt like just him moving his own hands. Over time it 
became more and more automatic and he felt non-ownership of the hands when she 
controlled them. Having gotten hands working using the gloves, Yolk was able to 
manage legs on her own.

I've pretty much settled on using a lightweight helmet with a small video 
screen in it, and trying to declare that whatever imaginary body is wearing it 
controls the physical body. I decided on this rather than gloves so that it 
applies to the whole body instead of only the hands. The idea is that I'll put 
it on my own wonderland body and go to a void. I'll imagine moving that while 
moving the physical body, to associate the two.

I've done a little of this already. When I focus on my imaginary body and move 
the physical body to match what I do with it, it makes my hands feel a little 
tingly and less like they're mine. When I sync hand movements with what Lyra 
does, I get a similar but smaller effect because I'm watching her and trying to 
move when she moves. It's one step further for the information to travel (Lyra 
conscious > Lyra body > my wonderland vision > body; instead of my 
consciousness > my wonderland body > body), so more separation and more lag. 
Currently if I stop consciously moving my hand, Lyra either can't move it at 
all, or slowly and clumsily as with the old method. Still, what we have working 
right now feels like shared control. I'm confident that with practice I can 
ease off my control and let her do it entirely herself, with no conscious 
interaction from me.

Note: I know that "no conscious interaction from me" is possible with this 
method. I was just chatting with Yolk while Lemonlemon was sleeping. She was 
there but typing increasingly derpily as she got sleepy as well.

EDIT: I'm now working with a somewhat different and more direct Yolk-based 
method. I relax some, and let a tulpa send faint urges that I act on. This does 
more or less the same thing, but with less complicated visualization and 
associating movement with objects. As before, the tulpa's control becomes more 
direct with time.

Oguigi and Koomer also wrote a possession guide that's closer to the method 
I had been using before. Their guide is written from the tulpa's standpoint, 
which makes it more likely to have an effect than simply relaxing and telling 
your tulpa to have at it. There's also a possession-and-switching idea dump 
I've been updating since May when, it possession was highly experimental.

# Imposition
## live snapshot

Yolk describes a separate wonderland that the mind uses to track a 3D model of 
the room around you. To be imposed, she puts herself in this place, adding 
herself to his internal map of his environment. She can also force objects in 
this place to impose those. When there, Lemonlemon can tell where she is in the 
room, and see her some of the time with varying levels of clarity. She says 
this is one of multiple wonderlands, which are 3D spaces, so she describes 
traveling between them as moving through the 4th dimension.

Her recommendation to me is that I describe this place to Lyra and try to have 
her find it. Then she should be able to place herself there and help with 
imposition. I haven't done anything on this yet.
