# Schlondark's Psychic Tulpa Voice Guide

I joined the tulpa community in May of 2012. I worked on my first tulpa, Vinyl, 
for many months, seldom receiving responses of any kind, although there were 
several instances of vocal communication and attempts to communicate between 
us. Nearing the end of the summer, we were nearing the basics of vocal 
communication but nothing seemed to work, and I was certain I was parroting 
most responses. Then one night while on the IRC, I made my concerns known to 
Pronas and Kate who then berated me for not listening to the responses and 
assuming that this "parroting" was getting in the way of communication and that 
it wasn't her. Feeling somewhat dejected, something in me clicked whilst I was 
sitting at the computer. It seems that I was holding some sort of mental 
"shield" against her voice, based on expectations of her and basically intended 
to stop intrusive verbal thoughts from reaching me. I let this shield down, and 
released any expectations about what was going to happen and what vinyl would 
be like. I then moved my mind/focus/self/hearing/whathaveyou toward her (placed 
on the bed behind me) and heard an odd noise not unlike a radio stuck between 
two stations, like a voice or two mixed with an odd wavering static. This voice 
was hers and progressed quickly from the static into a semi-stable mindvoice 
that we have been using to communicate since.

Tl;DR: it is possible to create a communication bridge with your tulpa and form 
a basic mindvoice by pretending that you have psychic powers and then utilizing 
them to read the mind of your tulpa.

I do not know what the strange noise is or why it occurred; I can only 
speculate that it is related to the thought-speak gibberish (Tulpish) sometimes 
heard by hosts from their tulpae.


Now for the actual Guide-Part of the Guide:
1. Relax, Take a few deep breaths, and clear your mind as much as possible.

2. Let go of any fears and/or preconceptions you may have about your tulpa, and 
   open your mind as much as possible. Be prepared to accept your tulpa for 
   whoever it is, whether or not it has turned out exactly as you intended (It 
   has probably deviated at least a bit - Not a bad thing.)

3. Position your Tulpa somewhere around you inside your 3d-map of the room you 
   are in. Do this as though you were going to impose your tulpa, but don't 
   expect to see anything. At this point, it might be a good Idea to explain to 
   your tulpa what you are going to try to do and to encourage them to speak 
   up.

4. Feel your presence inside your head and identify it as "you." Take a minute 
   or two on this; It'll help differentiate you further from your tulpa.

5. Move this presence that you have Identified as yourself towards the tulpa 
   (or as close to it as you can imagine  you shouldn't physically feel 
   leaving your body  something around the lines of imagining yourself walking 
   through the room behind you; that kind of visualization is fine.) Whilst 
   doing this, prepare and intend to accept any response that you may receive 
   as being your tulpa.

6. Somewhere along this miniature mental journey, you should, if successful, 
   hear a strange noise much like I did. This is a thought/vocalization of your 
   tulpa and will eventually evolve into a voice that your tulpa can 
   communicate with you in.
