# Counting Games
### By Gryphon Flight

Due to a while's struggle with having my own tulpa think separately from
myself, we felt the need to come up with ways to help her think for herself.
These are methods that can be done both passively and actively, and good for
times in which you need to work in short times or when sitting down to force is
not an available option.

## Method 1

The first is simple and easy. Simply lay out a number of items (preferably
between 10-20 of them) before you. These can be cards, dominoes, or any other
small item you can find. Ensure that you can see all of them at once while
staring directly at the middle of the objects. The objects should be spread out
to an extent, preferably not overlapping. It is important not to count how many
you are laying out, as this negates the process entirely.

Now that the objects are before you, stare in to the center of them and explain
to your tulpa what is going on. Ask them to count the unknown number of objects
before you and then give you the number. Do not participate in the counting
alongside them, simply stare and clear your mind. If you find yourself unable
to clear your mind, occupy it with something simple such as spelling, reciting
a poem, or simple math. Leave your mind open enough to hear your tulpa's
response.

Try not to move your eyes from the center in order to allow focus to be given
to your tulpa. Rely on them to count and give them a minute or so to do so.
After they let you know they are finish or decide that their time is up, ask
them how many objects their were and then count them yourself. It is optional
to keep track of how close they are to accuracy each time to track growth. With
this method, I find that my own tulpa generally gets it right 4/5 times with
almost no previous abilities to parallel process.

An alternative to this method is to lay out a random number of objects on one
side, then placing a divider beside the objects, and laying out a different
number of objects on the other side of the divider. Then , as you count the
amount of objects on the left side, you must rely on the tulpa to count the
amount of objects on the right side. For more of a challenge, set a time limit
of your comfort and gradually attempt to work down to lesser amounts of time to
count the objects.

## Method 2

This method is better for times in which you don't have as much time to spare,
you're constantly moving and having to divert your focus, or there are no
objects at your disposal. It shares close similarity with the first method.

Look around you for a word, preferably one with several letters, though do not
count the letters yourself. If you're in class, look at the posters, if you're
outside, look at the signs. If there are no words around you, use a random word
generator such as this one:

After you have the word, simply ask your tulpa how many letters are in the word
and then count them for yourself. The tulpa shouldn't require as much time to
count as they would with the objects in method 1. Ask them to report the number
of letters back to you and then count them yourself. This can also turn in to
a back and forth game by telling your tulpa a word, having them tell you the
amount of letters in it, and then having them tell you a word, and having you
tell them the number of letters in it.

If you're finding it difficult to keep your mind busy as they count the letters
in whichever word, you can use the option of giving yourself and your tulpa
a word and each of you having to count the number of letters in the word. This
allows your tulpa to think for itself while your own mind is busied.

I find this to be more of a basic tip for tulpamancer with tulpas still in the
earlier stages. It requires small amounts of vocalization, allowing younger,
more quiet tulpae to participate and help their parallel processing skills to
grow as well as older tulpas suffering from the same issue. The methods have
proved very effective for us, and I hope the same shows with other
tulpamancers.

The way in which these tactics assist the tulpa is simple. It forces the mind
of the tulpa to work on its own, without any input from yours. Due to your
conscious mind being busied with something else, it requires the tulpa to use
your subconscious thoughts and to form their own thoughts on what is happening.
It is a simple method to build up the parallel processing of the tulpa before
they move on to more complicated tests and tricks. By forcing the tulpa to
think for themselves when counting, they no longer feed off of the conscious
mind.
