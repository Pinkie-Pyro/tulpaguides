# Independence
### By Aarix

First off this is a guide and should be treated as such, take all the 
information with a grain of salt, following this step-by-step is not mandatory 
and its encouraged to apply your own tactics to this information that better 
suits you as an individual.

This guide is mainly for tulpas who have a clear mind voice, the main thing to 
get across is to help you and your tulpa become independent from each other. 
Let's first elaborate what I mean when I say a tulpas "independence" since it's 
not any real official meaning and is abstract, I'm referring to your tulpas 
ability to do more thinking and acting on his or her own without the absolute 
dependence of your concentration and focus.

All the advice I'll give is of my own personal experience, if you don't like 
it, simply move on!

Now, as many would tell you, their independence comes overtime, to simply go 
with the flow and continue on with talking to them and forcing, and that's 
perfectly alright. But I believe there is a little bit more you can do to 
possibly help. The key here is to constantly keep them in your focus 
habitually, kind of like an emulated feeling of your tulpa being independent. 
Though some would argue that is basically how a tulpa becomes independent. Let 
me just get on with it.

This is very common for early tulpas and tulpamancers even with mind voices, 
sure they can talk and do whatever but if you're not paying attention to them, 
they are unable to get to you as often as you like. If some are lucky, hosts 
get the occasional "alien response" but for the most part, if a tulpa wanted 
your attention, they had to wait for you to acknowledge them.

I imagine a window between us, with her on one side and me on the other, when 
I give her attention, it opens and she is around. But when my focus is off from 
her when I do practically anything, than it is shut and she is unable to do 
anything in general, let alone with me. But when they're independent they 
should be able to leave it open.

This used to be a crisis with me thought it took many, many months; my tulpa is 
around pretty much all the time unless I'm immensely busy and even then she is 
able to spectate a lot easier than before. I got so determined that I decided 
to obsess over keeping her in the front of my attention. I made it an absolute 
must to remember she's around. Every waking moment to visualize her in my 
peripherals, and always read what she is doing in my brain, and occasionally 
chit-chat, I would do that every waking moment, but conversations between us 
can only go so far. But still, the tiniest thing would make me forget about her 
for long times and I was angry at myself for it. So a few tricks I tried were 
the following.

Try to associate stuff you see all of the time with your tulpa, say your tulpa 
likes sandwiches, well assassinate them with a loaf of bread and every time you 
walk past your kitchen and see bread, you're reminded of your tulpa. If they 
love racing, associate them with moving cars, just do as much as you can, you 
need to consistently bring them up, it takes a lot of work and practice but 
over time it builds to form a habit than it becomes easier and easier to work 
on.

This is a good way to kill 2 birds with one stone if you do reality checks in 
attempts to obtain lucidity, get something like a watch or a wristband that 
would remind you of them, and set a reminder to check, like every half an hour 
you hear a beep on your phone or anything, remember when you forgot about your 
tulpa for a second and try to keep them in the front of your attention while 
you do other things. It takes a lot of mental work and practice to keep it 
consistent enough but if you need a reminder every 15 minutes, 30 minutes, an 
hour, even 5-10 minutes if you really need to work on it and that's perfectly 
acceptable.

Through it all, you need to keep it up, and tell your tulpa to make the best 
attempt they can, after a while, ask them what they were doing if you forgot 
about them for a second.

Another thing I used to do is, when I'm driving, have your tulpa sing the songs 
that are on the radio, takes less energy that hearing your tulpa talk and it's 
a good way to multitask, though I recommend you do this if you can handle 
listening to your tulpa sing while at the same time focusing on the road, it 
helped me though.

I've seen references say that having your tulpa count while you do whatever is 
a decent approach, personally I see this better suited to being a test of how 
well you can process your tulpa parallel to yourself. If they count and it's 
distracting your mind and thoughts, as if theirs and your thoughs are tangling 
up, then you need to work at it a little more.

When I did this, my tulpa was able to count to 1250 while I worked just fine, 
and I was even able to listen to instructions, with only a few things she lost 
count.

Another thing is to take into consideration is they're "thought forms" a.k.a, 
your own thoughts constructed productively. You know what else is of your own 
thoughts? Day dreams! Ever been so hypnotized inside of one of your own 
daydreams that you mumble the dialogue of it out loud or anything relating to 
that? That trance is probably the most easier and productive aspect to work on 
connecting to your tulpa passively. I like to consider it a hybrid between the 
two. Try to immerse your tulpa in a daydream state but instead of watching it 
mindlessly similar to hypnagogic, have just enough consciousness to talk to 
them like that. You may be working slightly less productively at work but if 
you practice this well enough, you should be talking to your tulpa more and 
more as the days and the weeks go by.
Anyway, that's about all I have, hope it helped, if not, well at least you have 
information!
