# Void Meditation
### By Anonymous

"Void Meditation" is what is known as "stilling the mind." The benefits of void
meditation are the ability to turn off unwanted thoughts and influences at
will, being able to control your thoughts instead of your thoughts controlling
you (as with the average person), and a sense of inner peace. Void meditation
is essential for anyone who practices power meditation, and is important for
success in advanced magickal practice. Power meditation changes the strength of
our thoughts and it is very important to be able to control thoughts and to
turn them off or focus them at will. Thought power, also known as 'witch power'
is needed for success in ritual and in using your mind to obtain what you want.
Power meditation, strengthens our thoughts, and people who are more aware or
sensitive will be able to pick up on our thoughts and feelings telepathically.
Void meditation will train your mind to be silent so others will not know what
you are thinking. The Japanese Ninja use this technique to avoid being detected
while carrying out important missions that require one to advance or
infiltrate, unnoticed. Void meditation trains your mind so you can focus during
rituals and in every day life so your mind brings you what you desire.

There are several techniques for void meditation. The goal is to turn off all
of your thoughts and focus on the here and now. You get your mind to be
completely still for a specified length of time. In the beginning, this can be
extremely difficult, as thoughts will come into your head continually. Before
you know it, you will again be thinking about something. Don't get upset with
yourself as this is very normal and even for advanced practitioners, certain
meditation sessions may not go as smooth as usual. Just keep bringing your mind
back to focus. Patience and persistence are the keys here. It definitely helps
to do some breathing exercises beforehand to induce a trance state. Some people
find meditating after a heavy meal causes the mind to be easily distracted.

Always try to meditate when you are fully awake and alert. If you try to do
void meditation when you are tired, chances are you will quickly fall asleep.

 - Breathing exercises are optional. This is a simple method of breathing that
   will induce a trance state:
   - Breathe in for a count of six
   - Hold your breath for a count of six
   - Exhale for a count of six

   Repeat this several times until you feel relaxed. Only hold as long as you 
   feel comfortable. If holding for a count of six is not comfortable, then 
   hold for a count of 4, or even 2. Just make sure you are uniform in your 
   counts. Never hold longer than is comfortable. Breathing exercises are never 
   to be pushed, as in doing so, they can cause damage to the nervous system.

-  Now, get your entire mind to be completely still and free of any thoughts
   for a specified amount of time with no thoughts or music in your head. Your
   mind should be a total blank. You should focus on being in the here and now.
   For beginners, five minutes is fine. Intermediate and advanced practitioners
   can go anywhere from 15 minutes to however long they feel is essential.

Void meditation can be done with your eyes open or closed. When your eyes are
open, you will more than likely see a mist around objects as you settle into
a trance state. This is normal. If you choose to close your eyes, you may fall
asleep, but this is an individual choice and use whatever method works best.
