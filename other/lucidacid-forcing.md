# Meditative Tulpaforcing Guide
### By LucidAcid

## What it is
Meditative forcing is, in essence, the integration of basic meditation 
techniques into regular tulpaforcing. This can be used for any stage of the 
creation process, although it appears works best for visualization and 
narration. Do note that all of this, much like tulpaforcing in general, is 
entirely subjective, and it's best to use this as a general guideline while 
tailoring it to suit your tulpaforcing style.

## Why you should do it and what to expect
Back during the nascency of modern tulpae, meditation was the crux of all of 
tulpaforcing. It was essential to have a decent amount of experience 
tulpaforcing, and all of the early major guides relied entirely on its use. 
This was largely because (from what little we know) the original Tibetan 
Buddhists who created tulpae did so through intense meditation, and the 
disassociation and concentration that comes with it. However, tulpaforcing has 
evolved, and moved on. Now, meditation is mainly used to boost concentration 
and have a stronger "connection" with your subconscious, and by extension, your 
tulpa. What you can expect from just 5-10 minutes of meditation before, or 
during each session is profoundly increased concentration, better visualization 
capabilities, and with regular practice, perceived time dilation and a better 
connection to your subconscious mind.

## How to do it
Through much experimentation and experience, I've found that the best form of 
meditation to use for tulpaforcing without prior experience is Pranayama, which 
happens to be one of the simplest and easiest to learn techniques available, as 
it's entirely based on breathing. The name Pranayama meaning "extension of the 
breath". For ease of understanding, I'll break it down into the following 
steps.
1. Find a    dark, quiet room where you know you won't be disturbed. The darker 
   and quieter the better.

2. While the stereotypical meditation pose of half-lotus     is recommended, 
   sit however is most comfortable for you with your back straight up. It's 
   also recommended to sit on a pillow or cushion for support.
   
3. Close your eyes and take one long, deep breath in through your noise, hold 
   it in for a few seconds, and slowly exhale through your mouth. Do this a few 
   times, or until you feel your pulse start to slow.
   
4. As you breathe    in, focus entirely on the feeling of air entering your 
   noise. The cold feeling of it going into your throat, and through to your 
   lungs. Pay attention to your lungs expanding as air enters them. The feeling 
   of your diaphragm expanding with your ribcage. Hold in the air for a few 
   seconds, and slowly release it, doing the same process as your exhale. Keep 
   repeating this step as long as you possibly can.
   
5. Inevitably   you're going to have intrusive thoughts popping up. This is 
   completely normal, and even the most seasoned meditation experts have to 
   deal with it. While most people say to ignore the thoughts, I find it's much 
   more beneficial to acknowledge them for a moment, before returning your 
   focus to your breathing. Acknowledge not only the thought itself, but what 
   might have caused the thought to come up. As you continue through your 
   meditation session, you should be getting less and less thoughts popping up, 
   and the ones that do should be harder to notice. Don't worry if it's 
   difficult at first, as it gradually becomes easier to handle with each 
   session.
   
6. Continue to do step 4, while doing step 5 whenever necessary for the whole 
   session. These sessions should be anywhere from 10-30 minutes, but if 
   necessary, even 5 minutes is vastly beneficial to going straight in to 
   tulpaforcing. If you'd like to increase the length of each session, increase 
   the session's time by 5 minutes per week until you've reached your desired 
   goal. That's really all there is to it.

What else to expect from regular meditation: By regularly doing meditation for 
10+ minutes per day, you'll have reduced physical pain and an enhanced immune 
system. Psychological detriments such as depression, anxiety, anger, and 
confusion are all greatly reduced, while benefiting from increased energy, and 
reduced stress. It greatly helps to control unwanted thoughts, and provides 
a sense of tranquility because of it. Meditation also promotes increased blood 
flow and slows the heart rate, leading to lower blood pressure and reducing 
your risk of a heart attack. It is even proven to actually reverse heart 
disease. This is all based on countless credible scientific studies, and there 
are even more benefits being discovered all the time.
