# Imposition via Mind Synthesis
### By Scrappy

This guides general purpose will be to help people to get into imposition via 
mind synthesis, you can call it self hallucinations but generally these aren't 
intended to be involuntary experiences but rather a controlled process so that 
you can have an easier time getting into imposition which will be included in 
this guide as well. If you find it a bit difficult to understand what exactly 
is being explained here don't be afraid to ask questions to others or to me 
especially. Now this guide assumes you have a fairly well developed tulpa to 
the point that you have no trouble seeing or hearing them in your mind, if 
you're unsure your tulpa is ready to get into these practices have a talk with 
them about it. When your ready to begin just keep reading on and make sure to 
pay attention as there is no tl;dr version of this.

To start your practices you must first work on audio synthesis to hear your 
tulpa outside of your mind as if someone was actually speaking to you. This is 
basically the reverse process of the basic sense of hearing, but instead you 
will be creating sound in your mind and repeating it to the point your ear 
actually picks up the sound if it were real. The best way to practice this is 
in a quiet space where there is little to no noise going on. Once you're ready 
just relax and think about a sound, voice, or even song you are very familiar 
with and have heard a multitude of times. You should be able to hear it in your 
mind as you think about, imagine yourself hearing every detail and the tone of the sound. 

The idea is to keep repeating the sound in your head in exact detail while 
focusing on it in your mind until you start physically hearing the sound. The 
length of this process will vary from person to person, so there is no 
particular time frame for this to take as you'll know the difference when 
you're synthing a sound to actually listening to it. If you cant think of 
anything to use just pick a song you enjoy and listen to it frequently to this 
point you have it memorized in your head that you would be able to repeat every 
word and beat of the song in your head. Once you have this process learned the 
next step is to start working on hearing your tulpas voice, if you know what 
it sounds like in your mind then all you need to do is the same practice you 
have been doing. Focus on the sound and tone of their voice, take anything they 
have said and repeat it over and over. It can be a simple phrase or basic 
sentence but the idea is to just keep repeating the sound of their voice in 
your head until you physically hear it. Once you're able to hear your tulpa 
speaking to you outside of your mind rather then inside then you can move onto 
the next parts.

Visualization will be considerably more difficult than the audio part so 
practicing this will take its time but you must not rush it or count time put 
into any of these practices. If you have a strong imagination you may find it 
slightly easier for you to practice visualizing your tulpa, again you should 
already have a strong detailed view of them in your mind to even be considering 
doing this. The way to go about this with a bit more ease is to imagine your 
tulpa with you always, no matter what it is you're doing or where you are 
picture them there somewhere with you. It may be difficult to focus on both 
your tulpa and the task at hand but it is doable, you just have to focus on 
both things at once. Keep on focusing them like this every day, every time, 
everywhere until it becomes second nature for you and your tulpa will be with 
you always regardless of what's going on. This can easily lead into imposing 
them through enough practice until you can physically see them around you. If 
you're struggling to fully impose your tulpa continue reading.

You can strengthen your visualization and practice through touch and smell as 
well, find a smell you can recognize and enjoy and always think about smelling 
it when your tulpa is around you so you have a stronger belief of their 
presence. As far as touch goes you can practice feeling your tulpa depending 
on if they have skin, fur, and etc. If you aren't sure what your tulpa might 
feel like try your best to imagine it. If you have to use something physical to 
help you then feel free to use it as guidance to help your process of feeling 
your tulpa. Ultimately this will lead to being able to physically see, hear, 
touch and smell your tulpa through continued practice until you finally 
succeed in doing so.

I hope you have enjoyed reading this guide, if it has helped you any then 
I would enjoy hearing about your experience while practicing the steps detailed 
here. As I stated before if you have any questions at all or don't quite fully 
understand one or more of the practices detailed in the guide then feel free to 
ask away and I'll be happy to explain it to you so you can understand it 
better.
