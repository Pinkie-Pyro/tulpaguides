# Tulpa Guide for Special People
### By FAQ man (tulpa.faq@gmail.com)

So, the first guide is SO LONG and SO HARD to understand, right? Well in this 
snarky sequel, I'll make it easier to understand for people that aren't very 
good English speakers, morons, and young people who don't know English beyond 
OMG. So, without further a due, here I go.

So, you want to make a tulpa. Here I will tell you how. This is not paranormal 
or supernatural, but rather a mental thing. No, this is not a mental disorder 
or an imaginary friend. You see and experience your tulpa like a normal person. 
Do not follow this guide perfectly- you don't have to. Instead, please make 
sure you just get to every step so you don't miss anything important. Making 
a tulpa is hard, and takes a long time. It took me 130 hours (2 and a half 
months). This is my method, and there are other methods out there you can try, 
okay?

When you make a tulpa do not work on it for more than three hours a day, or 
else you will feel very exhausted and not be able to function well. Making 
a tulpa is very hard on the brain, and if you're not used to visualizing 
things, then it may result in headaches and feeling very tired. This is normal, 
don't worry. Don't work on your tulpa for less than a half hour a day, because 
so little time is not very constructive. You can spread the time out throughout 
the day, but make sure you're not making the sessions last less than 20 
minutes.

Before you do anything you want to work on personality. Think about all the 
traits, likes, dislikes, biases, point of views, prejudices and everything you 
want your tulpa to have. What I did, is I turned this all into a sort of ball 
and focuses on each part of the personality until I knew it back to front. What 
you do may be different, because personality is highly personal, and is 
generally different for everyone. Please do this first, before even 
visualizing. This should take around 3 to 10 hours. People like to skip this, 
but please don't.

Next what you want to do is think about the form you want your tulpa to have. 
It should not be a living person, a dead person, a character, or yourself. It 
can be an animal, a rock, a person or anything else you can possibly think of, 
excluding the above. Just make it something you want to have for the rest of 
your life, and something that isn't a fleshed out character. The problem with 
the latter is that you'll be applying your ideas about the character to the 
tulpa, which will make it so it might not grow into its own being. This is 
generally a bad thing.

Unlike Irish's method I did not use a wonderland. What I did was sit down, look 
at the area in front of me, close my eyes and then imagine the tulpa on the 
area. I think this is a better method for people that don't want to imagine an 
entire world and a tulpa. When you first make a tulpa, you should think about 
it naked initially. Because if you don't, whatever clothes you put them in will 
become part of their form and they won't be able to change. You should only 
make them naked for the first half hour of visualization.

With visualization you strive to really focus on your tulpa's appearance until 
you can see it perfectly in your head. You should be looking at them from 
a "first person" point of view. This step is the easiest one for people to 
rush, but you should spend around 5 to 15 hours on it. More is always better, 
of course, and if you feel the need to spend more than 15 hours or so on 
visualization than that's fine.

Now what you want to do is start getting a feel for the texture of your tulpa. 
You can either physically put your hands out or pretend to feel them, or just 
do it within your mind. Again, how you do this step is mostly up to you. This 
should take 5-15 hours regardless of how well you think you're doing.

The next step in relation to sensory details is smell. You want to create 
a general smell for your tulpa. It can be as subtle or harsh as you want. Smell 
is important because of all our senses it triggers memory the best. Use this to 
your advantage! Skipping smell is something a lot of people like to do, but 
I feel it is very counteractive in the end. You only have to spend around 3 to 
10 hours on smell.

This next part is something a lot of people think is fun, because up until now 
your tulpa should have been basically standing still. This, by contrast, may be 
more entertaining for the budding tulpaforcer. What you do, is you design your 
tulpa's body language. How they walk, how they swing their arms, their posture 
and everything falls under this. Another thing you may want to do is to imagine 
their facial expressions for certain emotions. You don't have to do every 
single emotion but you should be putting enough time into it that you have 
a pretty solid idea of what most of their facial expressions look like. This 
should take another 5-10 hours to master.

Okay, now we are done with the basics of creation. Just because all this is 
done, doesn't mean you stop sitting down for X hours a day and working on your 
tulpa. Now you're just putting each main trait together all into one. You 
should continue to do this until your tulpa is completely finished in every 
sense of the word.

During any of these steps you might have noticed your tulpa doing something on 
its own, or gotten a sudden wave of emotion seemingly from the tulpa. These are 
both sure signs of sentience and are very good. I did not get an emotional 
response until l hit around 50 hours in; so really, don't expect something like 
this to happen so quickly.

Now we enter the stage of narration! Note that this does not in any way replace 
or nullify the sitting down and tulpaforcing. You still need to do that. With 
narration you basically want to be talking to your tulpa as much as you 
possibly can. Just make open ended conversation. Do not make up responses for 
them at any cost. This is called parroting and does not help you at all. In 
fact it hinders the creation of the separate consciousness. You can start 
narration any time you want, but I would not start until you've done at least 
visualization. That way you can hold and think about the image of the tulpa in 
your mind while narrating to them.

Some time around this period you may have the tulpa talk to you. It is very 
distinct from your own mind. This usually does not happen any time less than 25 
hours into creation. For me, my tulpa did not talk to me until I was 70 hours 
into creation. It is generally different for everyone. Talking is also a sure 
sign that your tulpa has it's own "mind".

As for the voice of the tulpa, it will start out being very generic, think like 
the voices they program into a GPS. It will become more normal and distinct as 
time goes on. If you have some idea of what you want the voice to be, be sure 
to sort of apply it by imagining your tulpa saying random words in that voice. 
Otherwise it will just basically become what it becomes and you don't have much 
control over that.

On another note, let's talk about deviation in tulpae. Tulpae will often change 
during the creation process. They change in the earlier stages because they are 
matching up with your subconscious ideal. This can and will differ from what 
you consciously want. Later on, when they have proved themselves to be 
sentient, they may change themselves further. You should not mess with or try 
reversing the changes, because what you're doing is basically forcing the tulpa 
into an identity it doesn't want. This is for the better, and you should accept 
the changes with open arms.

Okay, so before we start the next part, the following should be true: Your 
tulpa talks to you in complete sentences, your tulpa has its own opinions, and 
your tulpa sometimes does things you wouldn't expect. These are all signs of 
sentience.

Now, sit right back down on your ass. Tell your tulpa you are opening your mind 
to it, and imagine it walking through a door or something similar. This is when 
your tulpa will see your subconscious. From here on out it will know all your 
memories, how you feel, and pretty much everything about you as a person. You 
shouldn't do this right off, wait until trust is built. That way it is more 
meaningful; your tulpa will not take it for granted.

Now, this is when we begin to impose the tulpa on our reality. Say you're 
walking down the street. Imagine your tulpa just behind you, walking with you. 
Make sure you remember its gait. Do this almost at all times until it becomes 
natural. This took me a while to master. Next, start to impose the tulpa on 
your peripheral vision. It should never be fully seen, except for bits and 
pieces. Start to smell it, maybe have it brush your arm lightly or something. 
Force it upon all your senses, almost all the time. Soon enough, it will be 
there. This takes a while too and definitely don't rush it. Finally, begin to 
fully see, hear, smell and touch your tulpa, keeping it in fully view. Seeing 
the entire thing is not as easy as just bits and pieces, but with the 
preparation the peripheral vision gave you it should not be too hard. At this 
point, until you have it perfectly, you should still be sitting down and 
imagining your tulpa in front of you daily, for a couple hours. Talking, and 
doing whatever you do.

You know this step is done when your tulpa looks completely real to you and 
everything.

Great, now you're done making a tulpa. Now go learn English so you can 
appreciate the real guide.
