# A Tibetan Monk on Tulpas

> What do Tibetans truly think about the practice of thoughtforms and tulpas?

It looks like a very dangerous practice to partake in without the
instructions of a fully qualified master. From what I have read, it is clear to
me that advanced practices are only permitted when there is such genuine
guidance. Otherwise, there are many unpleasant and unwanted effects that can
emerge. Anything from madness, sudden loss, injury or even death in some
extreme cases may occur if the practices are performed inappropriately. Most
require an empowerment ceremony of sorts, and the whole thing can be very
colourful and ritualistic. Thoughtforms are not always helpful, and unless we
ourselves have a clear auric field, our eminations will also be impure.
Therefore whats the use of eminating putrid illusions of greed, anger and
delusion? Furthermore, it is very hard to know how the thoughtform will
interact with other people. In many cases, they can even invade the auric field
of another being by attaching themselves to the aura, which can result in
lasting damage. In fact, many people are possessed by many such illusory forms,
which cause them to produce unwholesome and harful behaviours. There is
a practice in tantra where during meditation the yogi visualizes a deity, in
order to receive blessings and to create a relationship with that quality of
the mind. There are some practices which can be done without empowerments, such
as Medicine Buddha, Green Tara or Vajrasattva. As I mentioned above, most
practices/meditational deities do require an empowerment because partaking in
such activites could result in unwanted effects. i have heard that highly
realized masters are able to eminate beings from their own mind-streams

> A lot of people believe tulpa to be psychological and hallucinatory in
nature, what do you think on this?

Have you read what Alexander Berzin has to say about the illusory body? It's
orth taking [a 
look](http://www.berzinarchives.com/web/en/archives/approaching_buddhism/introduction/extra_bodily_states.html).

So far, im seeing lots of warnings all over the place. Such practices need
proper guidance and supervision, otherwise really harmful effects arise: death,
madness, illness.. so on. Doesn't seem very pleasant. I have a feeling that 
many people are getting some small benefit from these practices, engaging in 
them without the guidance of a fully qualified master. however i dont feel like 
the benefit will last. maybe thats what is spreading this practice around all 
over the internet?

I think perhaps the internet is too young to have enough information about 
thoughtforms and tulpas. Maybe in books and in articles written by experienced 
people, but in forums, I'm not so confident. Maybe there are some masters out 
there who are capable of doing these things properly, so that there is only 
benefit that arises from such practices. Unfortunately, most of what I have 
seen thus far is misuse. Lots of mental illness arising from that misuse as 
well. Lots of anger and delusion from trying to extend a faulty sense of self 
outwards.
