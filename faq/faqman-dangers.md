In this document I would like to address the perceived dangers of making 
a tulpa. Lots of people expect and fear certain things happening to them, some 
of which are quite impossible or just unrealistic. Usually these fears come 
from ignorance on the topic or something of the like. In the following I'll put 
forth some regularly given reasons not to make a tulpa, and then my rebuttal 
based on my experiences and what I have collected from other sources.

> A tulpa will always try to kill you to escape because it will become jealous 
about how you can perceive and act in the world and it can't. It will want to 
experience the world and you're literally trapping it in your head. You're 
segmenting off a piece of your soul and trapping it, of course something is 
going to go wrong.

I see this more than I should considering it's completely ridiculous. Let me 
break down the errors in this kind of thinking point by point. Firstly, a tulpa 
cannot kill you. They have no kind of interaction with the physical world at 
all. They can't control your body processes either. Nor can they posses you and 
make you kill yourself. Secondly, people assume tulpae are all jealous by 
nature when really how they act is a tulpa by tulpa basis. Also, must tulpae 
don't get very jealous about not being able to operate as a person. They know 
what they are and they don't really mind too much. You can't miss what you 
never had.

Also, you're not trapping the tulpa anywhere. Trapping implies it could be free 
anyways, and this is not the case with a tulpa. Basically people have trouble 
putting the fact in perspective that tulpae are not actual beings. They're 
a part of your mind, and while they should be treated as something that 
actually exists, the fact remains that they don't. Bits of double think there, 
right?

> If you ignore your tulpa, it will get jealous. If you have other friends it 
will turn them against you. Your tulpa will hate if you fap to porn and it will 
get angry.

Time and time again I hear people saying that all tulpae are innately jealous, 
and if you don't gear all your attention toward them you're basically setting 
yourself up for disaster. All tulpae are different! Some need very little 
attention, some like to constantly be the center of it. Some will get a bit 
jealous, others won't. There is no rule for jealousy when talking about tulpae. 
That's just like trying to create rules for people, or groups of people. How 
your tulpa's personality turns out is not entirely up to you, and it is 
possible you may end up with these traits, but not likely if they're not a part 
of any of your ideals.

> The tulpa will eventually try to take over your body completely.

This goes hand in hand with the multiple personality things, but I think some 
things need to be said here regardless. I would like to say that firstly, even 
elective possession by a tulpa is not known to be entirely possible. 
Theoretically, of course it could happen- electively. But we have not had any 
trusted accounts of this, because everyone who claims to have done it cannot 
explain the process, nor do they seem like a legit source. Irish\_ and I don't 
want to try possession, and in the case of me, it is because all the 
implications of something else controlling the body completely freaks me out.

That being said, the tulpa can't really take possession by force, even if we 
accept the fact that it is possible.

> Tulpae will damage you psychologically because they're assholes

Alright, as with the first danger this has a lot wrong with it, but I'll 
basically break it down into two main points. Firstly, a tulpa can't damage you 
psychologically. Even if they were a giant dick, and did wish you harm, the 
most they would be capable of doing would be following you around and annoying 
you, scaring you by standing creepily in dark hallways, not letting you sleep, 
or just being a dick like that. They can't make you insane by somehow 
intertwining themselves in your psyche and ruining your mind. They can only 
really damage you about as much as a person who can't touch you can.

Secondly, your tulpa is not going to want to harm you in any way; even if you 
start to dissipate it for no reason or just generally act like a frothing 
douche. This is because firstly, they're a manifestation of your mind, and they 
know this. They know they would be putting their own very existence in danger 
by fucking with you. Also, you both have complete empathy for each other. You 
know each other's motivations, thought processes and everything. The tulpa 
really wouldn't harm you because by extension it can feel the harm its doing.

I think there's enough of a pattern here that you can now discern for yourself 
really what's going on here.
