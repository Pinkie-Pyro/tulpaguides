# DJFlix on Possession

## Liquid Color
What is your favorite color? That color resembles you, every time you think of 
that color you need to think of yourself. Now have your tulpa choose a color, 
it can't be close or the same to yours, if they do choose a color close or the 
same as yours, either you need a new color or they do, but just make everyone 
happy (I recommend blue and red) . Now associate their color with them, if you 
think about that color you should think of them. Now, onto the possession part, 
rest your hand on something, get it comfy, I don't care how. Look at it in your 
mindscape (thats the term I use, meaning how your mind's eye sees the real 
world, look at the real world through your mind's eye, you can close your eyes 
if you need.) your arm will be your color. You need to drain your hand of the 
color until you almost can't feel it, disassociate yourself from your hand. 
Drain the color into somewhere in your brain or something, in one very small 
point. Now ask your tulpa "Do you want to do this?" and "Are you ready?", you 
don't want to force them into a possession. If they say "Yes." then fill your 
hand with their color very slowly, at first all that will happen is slight 
twitching, ask them to touch your thumb and first finger together, at first the 
movements may feel like you, try to avoid this feeling. Once they got that 
down, ask them to clench your hand into a fist, the movements will be slow and 
choppy at first, but they will soon learn how to work your body. Do this as 
much as you can, then, when you feel ready, start moving up your arm, the first 
hardpoint is your upper arm, your tulpa must possess all the muscles that 
control your arm, and there are a lot of back muscles that you don't even 
realize you have. This method works for your whole body, but when you do this, 
you must do it for EVERY PART, your eyes, ears, mouth, nose, lungs, throat, 
voice box, everything. It takes a long time for full control to be 
accomplished, but when it is, the feeling is amazing.

## Basic Strength Exercise

Now that your tulpa can move your hand, have them try and put it in a fist, 
while (not taking control) try to open in through your subc, it will become 
a healthy battle for the hand, if they close it they win, if you open it you 
win, simple as that.

## Advanced Liquid Color, Supernova style

Once Liquid color becomes easy to you, you can do what I do for possession. 
Disassociate from your body completely, then, starting at the top of your 
brainstem, create a supernova of your tulpa's color, have it (very slowly) go 
over your whole body, the more you do this, the faster the supernova can go.
